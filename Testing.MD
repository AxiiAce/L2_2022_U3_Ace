# Tests for Functionality

* Test to see how the Sway functions on different browsers and whether the format stays consistent for them all.

  * The sway works on chrome, firefox and on the office 365 application. I also tested it on my computer at home and know that it works for different people (This is also how I discovered it worked on the application).

* Test to see how all the information reads, look for any typos and grammatical errors and fix them.
  
  * I looked through the whole portfolio again and fixed any errors I found. there weren't many but I did see that I missed a few letters in some words such as 'willing' where I missed one of the Ls.
  
    Other than that there weren't many other issues and the whole document read very smoothly.
