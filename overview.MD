# Audience & Purpose

This portfolio is created with potential future employers in mind. Everything that's placed in it is put in with the assumption that it's good information to know. As usual for most of my things, it needs to be simple and easy to understand but engaging as not to bore anyone into clicking off it before they read anything that would interest them.

# Final Assessment/Evaluation

The portfolio fits the vision I set out with. It is a good representation of me as a person and provides adequate information into what makes me a good person to hire.

It is very simple and not clunky in appearance or functionality.

Sway is a very good application to use for something like this as it allowed me to focus on the quality of the information I used instead of worrying too much over what the whole Sway looked like.

I have provided proof of a lot of the achievements I've mentioned as well as provided reasoning for mentioning any of the good qualities I possess.

The portfolio features all of my achievements I could think of and provides proof in the form of photos (Such as my GCSE grades and MOS scores), it also provides examples for attributes I listes such as my willingness to learn being supported by me learning how to write in Russian in 6 months. All of this provides any potential employer with a slew of information regarding me as a person and potential employee. 

All together, this Sway presentation checks all the boxes I set out with and I'm happy with the work i've done.
