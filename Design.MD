# Navigation

Navigation doesn't apply here due to it being on Sway and only 1 page.

# Storyboard/Layout

Due to the portfolio only being one long page with the different sections only seperated by titles, I drew out the storyboard as just a layout of the order of content I wished to put down.

The rest of the time should be dedicated to documentation which should be finished by July 1st (At the latest).
