* Adam - I like the colour scheme, aswell your grades are easily seen and you have evidence which is pretty cool. 
The about me part is very detailed and says alot about you, when it comes to achievements you have a lot of 
achievements and they all have evidence to suppport them. There are no negatives to this portfolio, I really like it.

* Patryk - I really like your portfolio, Colour scheme fits with a style of choice in SWAY. Achievements of yours are really great, and easy to see them by having evidence as an image. I see no negatives to this portfolio.

* Harry - It's great. You've cleanly and consisely noted information about yourself that an employer would want to see, with suitable imagery and explaination behind it. It gets wordy at points but I think it's more than suitable for an employer.
